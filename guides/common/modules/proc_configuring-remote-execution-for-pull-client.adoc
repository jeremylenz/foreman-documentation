= Configuring Remote Execution for Pull Client

By default, Remote Execution uses SSH as the transport mechanism for the Script provider.
However, Remote Execution also offers a pull-based transport option, which communicates with hosts via MQTT.
This is a good option if you are migrating from `katello-agent` which also uses pull-based communication.

.Procedure
* Enable the pull-based transport on each relevant {SmartProxyServer}:

The mode is configured per {SmartProxy}.
Some {SmartProxies} may be configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode while others use `ssh`.
If this is the case, it is possible that one remote job on a given host will use the pull client, and the next job on the same host will use SSH.
If you wish to avoid this scenario, configure all {SmartProxies} to use the same mode.

In `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts subscribe to the {SmartProxy} they are registered through for job notifications.
Therefore, it is recommended to ensure that {ProjectServer} sends remote execution jobs to that same {SmartProxy}.
To do this, in the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
On the *Content* tab, set the value of "Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution" to *Yes*.

After the pull-based transport is set up on a {SmartProxy}, it must also be configured on each host.
For more information, see {ManagingHostsDocURL}Configuring_and_Setting_Up_Remote_Jobs_managing-hosts[Configuring and Setting Up Remote Jobs] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.

NOTE: The `pull-mqtt` mode works only with the Script provider.
Ansible and other providers will continue to use their default transport settings.
